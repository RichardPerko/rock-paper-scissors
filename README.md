This game will allow you to play rock paper scissors against the computer. Im excited to start coding this as my first real project!

It took me a few weeks of slow working to get this where it's at right now. Even though it took me so long I am happy with where I am with it. It is a simple program for sure but it really helped solidify alot of my basic html/css/javascript knowledge.

If you wish to verify your choice a console log is printed after each pick, including your own and the computer's choices. Enter your browsers console to view this.

As a reflection I would have liked to add varying pictures based on who wins each round/game. But I decided that I have spent a lot of time on this project and it's time to move on!
